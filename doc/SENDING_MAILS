Sending Mails
=============

G'n'T-Eval leverages Rails’ mailing feature to send mass mails. There is no
clickable GUI, but it can be easily used via the interactive ruby shell. If
you don’t know about irb, best start with the guides in INTERACTIVE_
EXPLORING_(IRB). 


Localization
------------

Mails are automatically translated, depending on the language set in the
course. If a subject is not translated, Rails will abort. Please note that
mails may have already been sent if this occurs. If the message body
translation is missing, the default locale will be used. For now, only
German message bodies exist.

change subjects in: web/config/locale/*.yml (look for postoffice block)
change bodies in: web/app/views/postoffice/*.text.erb

Rails prefers a localized version if available. If you want to create
a localized variant for, say, Spanish, create a file called 
  <mailtype>.es.text.erb
The default language is defined by the symlink without the locale part.


Mail types
----------

ankuendigungsmail: mails profs
  Sends mail to the prof/profs of the given course. The mail contains
  all details for the course, so the profs may send corrections. It
  also serves as reminder that an evaluation is going to take place.
  Put the date/time information in the description field, to let them
  know when the eval is carried out.

erinnerungsmail: mails “evaluated by”
  Sends a reminder mail to the “evaluated by” person that she should
  carry out the evaluation. If there are multiple people listed, all
  of them receive the mail. Contains some details of the course, so
  last minute errors may be spotted.

evalverschickung: mails profs
  Sends each prof of the given course the result for the *whole* term.
  Since the result PDF files may be too large, they cannot be attached
  directly. Instead, you need to provide an array that matches faculty_
  id to an URL where the evaluation is available. Experience shows that
  this URL should be publicly available and not behind a password
  protected proxy or VPN.
  
single_evalverschickung: mails profs
  Mails each prof the evaluation for the given course. Like eval-
  verschickung, an array matching faculty_id to URL to evaluation for
  the whole term is expected. Additionally you can pass a path where
  the per-course result PDFs are located. If you didn’t change anything
  and used rake results:pdf_singles, you may omit the path. The
  per course file is attached, while the eval for the whole term of
  the faculty is only linked.
  
  

Actually sending mails
----------------------

Change into G'n'T-Evals root directory. Modify the body text for the
mail you want to send first. In this example an “erinnerungsmail” is sent,
so modify web/app/views/postoffice/erinnerungsmail.*.text.erb.

After that, run “irb” and use the commands below to send mass mail.

# boots rails and connects to the database
require "./web/config/environment.rb"

# see which terms are considered active
Term.currently_active

# find all courses in all currently active semesters
ccs = Term.currently_active.map { |s| s.courses }.flatten

# it is good practice to only send each mail once. If a mail is
# being sent, this is marked in the course. Please note that this
# feature does not detect bounces or other mail failures.
ccs.reject! { |c| (c.mails_sent || "").include?("erinnerungsmail") }

# list selected courses
ccs.map { |c| c.title }

# test how a generated mail looks like. This does not yet send
# the mail.
m = Postoffice.erinnerungsmail(ccs.first.id)
puts m.header
puts m.body

# If it looks good, you can try to send it:
m.XXXdeliver
# Obviously, you need to remove the XXX for it to work. They were
# added to prevent accidental mails by copy & paste errors.
# By default all mails will be sent to a debug address and you need
# to flip a switch before they are sent to the real people. You can
# change the debug address in web/app/mails/postoffice.rb near the
# top.
# Note that debug mails do NOT update the mails_sent field for the
# course. 

# Once the debug mail arrives at your account and looks fine, you
# may want to actually send the mass mails. For it to work, you
# have to modify postoffice.rb once again and flip the debug
# variable in the “erinnerungsmail” method. Also, you need to re-
# start the irb because the file is not reloaded automatically.
# It’s recommended to set debug to true again once you sent all
# mails to prevent accidents.

# So, you’re absolutely sure everything is fine. Run this to spam:
ccs.each { |c| Postoffice.erinnerungsmail(c.id).XXXdeliver }

# Don’t forget to flip debug to false again.






# Other types of mail work similarily. For example, mails for
# single_evalverschickung may be generated like this. It’s assumed
# you ran “rake results:pdf_singles” beforehand.

# Find IDs for each faculty:
Faculty.all.map { |t| "#{t.id}=#{t.shortname}" }

# Assume we have the faculty IDs 4 and 2, then:
links = { 4 => "http://…/eval_for_term_4.pdf", 2 => "…for_term_2.pdf" }

# we don’t want to send them for faculty 1 yet:
ccs.reject! { |c| c.faculty_id == 1 }

m = Postoffice.single_evalverschickung(some_course.id, links)
m.XXXdeliver
